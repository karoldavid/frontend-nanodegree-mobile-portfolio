## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

#### This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nano Degree.

https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd00

#### The code was forked from:

https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio.git

#### Here is a link to the live version:

http://karoldavid.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/

### HOWTO

On the bottom of the mobile portfolio page (index.html) you will find a
link to Cam's Online Pizzeria (views/pizza.html).

Once you get to the online pizzeria, you may scroll down or you can
click on one of the menu items "Menu", "Our Ingredients",
"Pick a Pizza Now!" to get to the slider, which allows you to adjust
your pizza to one of three sizes.

### Project Overview

Project 4 consists of two parts:

1. Mobile Portfolio Performance Optimization
2. Cameron's Pizza Shop's Rendering Optimization.

The optimization results will be rated for:

1. Time for initial page load in 'index.html'
2. Smooth browser animations and efficient code execution in 'views/js/main.js' for
   the pizzeria page under 'views/pizza.html'

### Measured Results

1. Mobile Portfolio Page (index.html):

* 93% Speed on Mobile
* 95%  Speed on Desktop
* 100% Mobile UserExperience

=> https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/

2. Cam's Online Pizzeria (views/pizza.html, views/js/main.js):

* scrolling is under 60 frames per second
* the time to resize a pizza is less than 5ms

=> shown in the browser console

### Additional Rating

Static assests such as images, css and javascipt files are automatically
optimized, concatenated and/ or mini-/ uglyfied with Grunt. Grunt Watch automates
this task. It simply lurks for any changes in the script, sheets and image folders
to run the specific tasks. html lint.

### Optimization of Cam's Online Pizzeria:

Basically, I was looking for possible optimizations of JavaScript, Layout and Paint
execution (The Critical Rendering Path: HTML -> CSSOM <- JavaScript -> Render Tree
-> Layout -> Paint).

To get started, I was on the lookout for the more obvious bottlenecks in
'views/js/main.js', that are usually easier to change.

For example, I asked myself if there is really a need to animate 200 background pizzas?
After some experimenting, I reduced this number to a more reasonable size of 25:

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      [...]
      for (var i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        [...]
      }
      [...]
    });

To save more SCRIPTING TIME, I calculated variables, where possible, outside the For Loops,
like the 5 phases in the function updatePositions():

    function updatePositions() {
      [...]
      var phases = [];
      for (var x = 0; x < 5; x++) { phases[x] = Math.sin((document.body.scrollTop / 1250) + x); }
      for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
        items[i].style.transform = 'translateX(' + parseInt(items[i].basicLeft + 100 * phases[i % 5] - halfScreenWidth ) + 'px' + ')';
      }
      [...]
    }

... I accessed, where possible, the DOM outside the For Loops and I avoided calculating
unnecessary values like 'dx':

    function changePizzaSizes(size) {
        var newWidth;
        switch(size) {
          case "1":
          newWidth = 25;
          break;
        case "2":
          newWidth = 33.3;
          break;
        case "3":
          newWidth = 50;
          break;
        default:
          console.log("Bug in sizeSwitcher");
          break;
      }
    
      var randomPizzas = document.getElementsByClassName("randomPizzaContainer");
      for (var i = 0; i < randomPizzas.length; i++) {
        randomPizzas[i].style.width = newWidth + "%";
      }
    }

The next change reduced the SCRIPTING TIME, too. There is no need to access the DOM element
for every single scroll. Therefore, I created an array variable 'items', that has a reference
to all of the pizzas that have the class name "mover":

    [..]
    var items = [];
    [..]
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      [..]
      // get all moving pizza objects from the DOM and put them into one array to reduce DOM access
      items = document.getElementsByClassName('mover');
      [..]
    });

Furthermore, I reduced the LAYOUT TIME by using faster methods to access the DOM (for example:
'document.getElementsByClassName()' instead of 'document.querySelectorAll()'):

    function changePizzaSizes(size) {
      [..]
      var randomPizzas = document.getElementsByClassName("randomPizzaContainer");
      [..]
    }

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      [..]
      for (var i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        [..]
        document.getElementById("movingPizzas1").appendChild(elem);
      }
      [..]
    });

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      [..]
      items = document.getElementsByClassName('mover');
      [..]
    });

Even if the performance gain is not so big, I was curious to implement the CSS3 hardware acceleration
with 'transform: translateX()', and to avoid to trigger re-layout:

    function updatePositions() {
      [...]
      for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
        items[i].style.transform = 'translateX(' + parseInt(items[i].basicLeft + 100 * phases[i % 5] - halfScreenWidth ) + 'px' + ')';
      }
      [...]
    }

Then, I reduced the PAINT TIME by forcing each moving pizza into its own composite layer to let the
Graphics Processing Unit do the work. Adding 'backface-visibility' to the css mover class in
'views/css/style.css' did the trick:

    .mover {
      position: fixed;
      width: 256px;
      transform: translateZ(0);
      backface-visibility: hidden;
      z-index: -1;
    }

When we scroll now, the browser will only repaint the pixels that are affected by the moving pizzas.
There is no need anymore to repaint the whole screen.

Finally, I created an own optimized image file ('views/images/pizza-100.png') for the background pizza,
having the exact size it has on a normal desktop screen. The resizable pizza got it's own optimized image
file ('views/images/pizza-200.png'), too.
